<p>You might recall that every time we ran our app, we got a warning telling us that when we want to make our website go
    live and go from development to production mode that we should use a <strong>WSGI</strong> server.</p>

<p>WSGI stands for Web Server Gateway Interface and it's described here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/</p>
<p>It standardises the language and protocols between our Python Flask application and the host server.</p>
<p>Again, but in English: Normal web servers can't run Python applications, so a special type of server was created
    (WSGI) to run python applications. </p>
<p>There are many WSGIs to choose from, but we'll use the most popular - <strong>gunicorn</strong>.</p>
<p>So Heroku will call gunicorn to run our code and gunicorn will know how to speak to Heroku. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1. In PyCharm go to the Python Interpreter for your Project and install the gunicorn package:</p>
<p>Windows: Files -&gt; Settings -&gt; Project: blog-with-user -&gt; Python&nbsp;Interpretor</p>
<p>Mac: PyCharm -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Project: blog-with-user -&gt; Python&nbsp;Interpretor</p>

<p>Note: Make a note of the version of gunicorn you installed e.g.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>2. Add the package to the requirements.txt file on a new line:</p>
<p>gunicorn==&lt;version number&gt;</p>

</figure>
<p>NOTE: Your version number will be higher than mine because you are in the future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next, we need to tell Heroku about our gunicorn server and how to run our Flask app, we do that using a Procfile.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3. Create a new file in the project top-level folder called <code>Procfile</code></p>
<p>NOTE: make sure you spell the name of the file exactly as you see above, with a capital P and no file extension. </p>
<p>Type the following into the Procfile:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">web: gunicorn main:app</pre>
<p>This will tell Heroku to create a <code>web</code> worker, one that is able to receive HTTP requests. </p>
<p>To use <strong>gunicorn</strong> to serve your web app</p>
<p>And the Flask <strong>app</strong> object is the <strong>main</strong>.py file.</p>
<p>NOTE: If your app is not inside a file called main.py then you should change main to your file name.</p>
<p><br></p>

</figure>
<p><br></p>
<p>4. <strong>Add</strong> the new Procfile/requirements.txt to git and <strong>commit</strong> the changes then push it
    to the remote. </p>

</figure>
<p>Note: If you forgot to "Commit and Push" and just clicked on "Commit" then just go to VSC -&gt; Git -&gt; Push</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Because we enabled automatic re-deploys, if you go to your app's logs you should see it being re-built an re-deployed
    with the changes we have pushed to GitHub.</p>

<p>All going well, you should now be able to go to your app and see the blog up and running. </p>
